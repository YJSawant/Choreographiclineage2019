Licata is an Instructional Support Technician and Instructor with the Department of Art at the University at Buffalo. His primary areas of focus are Graphic Design and Emerging Practices. He received an M.Ed. in Education and Technology from UB in 2008. Domenic maintains technologies which foster art- and design-making collaboration and constructive learning experiences. He teaches several courses which he has developed, including Web Design, Introduction to Digital Practices, and 2D Animation. He is interested in finding meaning through visual rhetoric and semiotics within postmodern culture, searching for ways in which cultural practices mesh with teaching and learning theories of social constructivism.

					<h4>Welcome to the Choreographic Lineage!</h4>
					<p>Thank you for visiting our site. We hope you will spend time browsing through artists and their lineal connections on the network. We also hope that you will contribute your own lineage to this expanding global resource.</p>

					<h4>What is Choreographic Lineage?</h4>
					<p>Choreographic Lineage is an interactive, web-based genealogical network illustrating connections between <font color=#0820aa> dance artists,</font> their  <font color=#016400> teachers, </font> their <font color=#016400> students,</font> their <font color=#969101> collaborators</font> and people who they were influenced by. The main goal is to establish a knowledge base documenting 20th and 21st century dance that is searchable and minable and that will continue to grow as new generations of artists are added. Choreographic Lineage is intended as a global resource for investigating artistic influences, career paths, choreographic connections, and complex and obscure relationships.</p>
